Introduce our conversion package specifically designed for JavaScript frameworks, enabling seamless conversion of Nepali Unicode text. This package offers developers a convenient and efficient solution for displaying Nepali content in Unicode format across various applications, websites, or systems.

To incorporate our package into your project, you have two options based on the module system you are using. If you are utilizing CommonJS, you can import the package as follows:

```javascript
const nepaliKeyboard = require('nepali_keyboard');
```

For those who prefer ES6 module syntax, you can import the package using the following statement:

```javascript
import nepaliKeyboard from 'nepali_keyboard';
```

Once imported, you can easily utilize the package's functions. For instance, you can employ the `convertToUnicode` or `preetiToUnicode` function to convert Preeti text to Nepali Unicode text:

```javascript
import { convertToUnicode } from 'nepali_keyboard';

console.log(convertToUnicode('value'));

// Conversion from Preeti text

import { preetiToUnicode } from 'nepali_keyboard';

console.log(preetiToUnicode('value'));
```

Executing this code will log the converted Nepali Unicode text for the given Preeti text.

Our package encompasses several key features that enhance the development experience:
1. Cross-framework compatibility: It seamlessly integrates with all JavaScript frameworks, ensuring versatility in any development environment.
2. Effortless conversion: With a simple function invocation, you can effortlessly convert Preeti text to Nepali Unicode text, saving time and effort.
3. Comprehensive character mapping: The package includes a comprehensive algorithm that accurately converts Preeti to Nepali Unicode, preserving the integrity of the original text.
4. High performance: It is optimized for performance, enabling efficient conversion even for large volumes of text.

Our powerful package, designed for JavaScript frameworks, allows seamless conversion of Preeti text to Nepali Unicode text. It offers developers a convenient solution for displaying Nepali content in Unicode format across applications, websites, or systems.

To use the package, you have two options based on the module system you're using. If you're using CommonJS, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const nepaliKeyboard = require('nepali_keyboard');
```

If you prefer ES6 module syntax, you can use the following import statement:

```javascript
import nepaliKeyboard from 'nepali_keyboard';
```

Once imported, you can invoke the package's functions. For example, you can use the `preetiToUnicode` function to convert Preeti text to Nepali Unicode text:

```javascript
import { preetiToUnicode } from 'nepali_keyboard';

console.log(preetiToUnicode('value'));
```

This code will log the converted Nepali Unicode text for the provided Preeti text.
